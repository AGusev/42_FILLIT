# Fillit

### What is fillit
-----------------------
A project to familiarize with a recurring problematic in programming. I used a recursive backtracking algorithm to fit some Tetriminos together into the smallest possible
square in the minimal amount of time.


### How to use it
-----------------------
Download/clone this repository.

Run `make` in the fillit folder. An executable file called `fillit` should compile directly.

To execute the program run
`./fillit tetranimo-example.txt`
